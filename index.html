          <h2>Why Cyprus</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="cols">
          <div>
            <h3>Why Choose Cyprus?</h3>
            <p class="muted">Cyprus has established itself as one of the most reliable business hubs in Europe, thanks
              to its strategic location, modern legal framework, and business-friendly tax system.</p>
            <h3>Tax Advantages:</h3>
            <ul class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0 18px">
              <li>The corporate tax rate is currently 12.5% and will increase to 15% in 2026 to align with international
                standards. Despite this increase, it remains competitive compared to other European countries.</li>
              <li>Additionally, dividends received from subsidiaries are tax-exempt, provided the subsidiary generates
                more than 50% active income and is subject to an effective tax rate of at least 6.25%.</li>
              <li>There is no withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders within the EU, facilitating free
                movement of profits.</li>
              <li>Finally, Cyprus does not impose capital gains tax on the sale of shares or securities in subsidiaries,
                offering flexible exit options.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Services & Infrastructure:</h3>
            <p class="muted">Cyprus offers high-quality professional services, a fast company registration process, and
              modern banking, legal, and accounting infrastructure.</p>
            <h3>Quality of Life:</h3>
            <p class="muted">With excellent infrastructure, favorable relocation programs, and a high standard of
              living, Cyprus is an ideal destination for entrepreneurs and their families.</p>

        <details>
          <summary>What is the procedure for opening a bank account?</summary>
          <p class="muted">Online application → completion of bank account forms → submission of ID and supporting
            documents → identity verification (KYC) → source of funds and source of wealth check → verification call →

          <summary>Can a non-resident open a bank account?</summary>
          <p class="muted">Yes, many banks accept non-residents, but the requirements are stricter (e.g. additional
            documentation, tax declaration from the country of residence).</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What documents are required for opening of bank account?</summary>
          <p class="muted">For directors and UBOs: a valid ID or passport, proof of address, source of funds, source of

        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How long does it take to incorporate a company in Cyprus?</summary>
